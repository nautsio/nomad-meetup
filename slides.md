Nomad is a tool for **managing a cluster of machines and running applications on them**. Nomad **abstracts away machines** and the location of applications, and instead **enables users to declare what they want to run** and Nomad handles where they should run and how to run them.

- **Job, Task & Taskgroup**: A Job is a specification of tasks that Nomad should run. It consists of Taskgroups, which themselves contain one ore more Tasks.
- **Allocation**: An Allocation is a placement of a Task on a node.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluations are the mechanism by which Nomad makes scheduling decisions.
- **Node, Agent, Server & Client**: A Client of Nomad and a Node are a machine that tasks can be run on. Nomad servers are the brains of the cluster. An Agent can be run in either Client or Server mode.
- **Task Driver**: A Driver represents the basic means of executing your Tasks.

# Jobs

!SUB
# Job types
- **Service**: The service scheduler is designed for scheduling long lived services that should never go down.
- **Batch**: Batch jobs are much less sensitive to short term performance fluctuations and are short lived, finishing in a few minutes to a few days. They can be scheduled and recurring.
- **System**: The system scheduler is used to register jobs that should be run on all clients that meet the job's constraints.

doc: [/docs/jobspec/schedulers.html](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/jobspec/schedulers.html)

!SUB
# Task drivers
- **Docker**: Run a Docker container
- **Rkt**: Run a Rkt container
- **Exec**: Execute a command for a task using the underlying isolation primitives of the operating system to limit the tasks access to resources
- **Rawexec**: Execute a command for a task without any isolation
- **Java**: Run a downloaded Java jar file
- **Qemu**: Start a Virtual Machine

# Creating
Nomad can initialize an example job for us which we can then modify to our own requirements:

```
$ nomad init
Example job file written to example.nomad

$ cat example.nomad
# There can only be a single job definition per file.
# Create a job with ID and Name 'example'
job "example" {
    # Run the job in the global region, which is the default.
    # region = "global"
...
```

!SUB
```
job "helloworld" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "service"

  update {
    stagger = "30s"
    max_parallel = 1
  }

  group "hello-group" {
    count = 1
    task "hello-task" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image = "b.gcr.io/kuar/helloworld:1.0.0"
        port_map { http = 80 }
      }
      resources {
        cpu = 100
        memory = 200
        network { port "http" {} }
...
```
jobs/helloworld-v1.nomad

!SUB
# Launching
Use the run command of the Nomad CLI:
```
$ export NOMAD_ADDR=http://nomad-01.stack.gce.nauts.io:4646
$ nomad run helloworld-v1.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "3d823c52-929a-fa8b-c50d-1ac4d00cf6b7"
    Evaluation triggered by job "hellloworld-v1"
    Allocation "f67a-72a4-5a13" created: node "5b7c-a959-dfd9", group "hello"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "3d823c52-929a-fa8b-c50d-1ac4d00cf6b7" finished with status "complete"
```

<br />
You can also submit a job in JSON format to the HTTP API endpoint:
```
$ curl -X POST -d @helloworld-v1.json $NOMAD_ADDR/v1/jobs
```
doc: [/docs/http/index.html](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/http/index.html)

!SUB
# Where is our job?
```
$ curl -s $NOMAD_ADDR/v1/job/helloworld/allocations | jq .
{
  ...
}
```

Search for the allocations where **.TaskStates.helloworld.State** is not "dead" and collect their **.ID**'s. For each of those .ID's:
```
$ curl -s $NOMAD_ADDR/v1/allocation/<ID> | jq .
{
  ...
}
```
Inside the **.TaskResources.helloworld** block, for each of the **.Networks**, collect the **.IP** and for each of the **.DynamicPorts**, their **.Value**.
Those are the ip's and corresponding ports for your service.

!SUB
Or you can use some JQ-fu and get it with a script:

```
#!/bin/bash
JOB=$1
TASK=$2

# This obviously only works if there is just one port exposed per task.
for ALLOC in $(curl -s "$NOMAD_ADDR/v1/job/$JOB/allocations" \
  | jq -r '.[] \
  | select(.TaskStates.'"$TASK"'.State != "dead") \
  | .ID');
do
  curl -s "$NOMAD_ADDR/v1/allocation/$ALLOC" \
    | jq -r '.TaskResources.'"$TASK"' \
    | .Networks[0].IP + ":" + (.Networks[0].DynamicPorts[0].Value | tostring)'
done

$ ./get_job_address.sh helloworld hello-task
10.20.30.8:42957
```

!SUB
Check that the job is running properly by calling it:
```
$ curl http://10.20.30.8:42957
Hello v1
```

!SUB
# Constraints
By specifying constraints you can dictate a set of rules that Nomad will follow when placing your jobs. These constraints can be on **resources**, self applied **metadata** and other configured **attributes**.

```
constraint {
  attribute = "$node.datacenter"
  value = "dc1"
}
```
doc: [/docs/jobspec/index.html](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/jobspec/index.html)

<br />
- *What happens if you target a constraint that can't be met?*

!SUB
# Restarting
Very few tasks are immune to failure and the addition of **restart policies** recognizes that and allows users to rely on Nomad to keep the task running through transient failures.

```
restart {
  interval = "1m"
  attempts = 2
  delay = "15s"
  on_success = true
  mode = "delay"
}
```
doc: [/docs/jobspec/index.html](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/jobspec/index.html)

!SUB
# Scaling
Nomad can handle the scaling of your application for you, all you have to do is provide the **desired amount** of instances you want to be running.
This can only be applied on the **taskgroup** level.

```
count = 5
```
doc: [/docs/jobspec/index.html](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/jobspec/index.html)

<br />
- *What happens if you make the count larger than the number of machines?*

!SUB
# Updating
Nomad allows us to easily do **rolling updates**. Add the **update block** and change the **version** of our job, to do a rolling update.

```
job "helloworld" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "service"

  update {
    stagger = "30s"
    max_parallel = 1
  }

  group "hello-group" {
    count = 5
    task "hello-task" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image = "cargonauts/helloworld:v2"
...
```

- Uses Consul to expose services and works **without bootstrapping**
- Defined **inside the job description**
- **No external tools** such as Registrator needed

  tags = ["hello", "v1"]
  port = "http"
  check {

# Resource management

!SUB
In order to schedule jobs on the right nodes, Nomad needs to know **which resources**
are available and **where**, and which resources a job needs. Nomad currently can manage the following resources:
- CPU cycles
- memory
- Disk space
- Disk IO
- Network ports
- Network IO

!SUB
# Available Resources  
The 'node' endpoint shows the detected resources:

```
$ curl http://localhost:4646/v1/node/0af1abf0-d55c-3923-188f-495bed729a4e | jq .Resources
{
  "CPU": 2500,
  "MemoryMB": 1704,
  "DiskMB": 7493,
  "IOPS": 0,
  "Networks": [
    {
      "Device": "eth0",
      "CIDR": "10.20.30.5/32",
      "IP": "10.20.30.5",
      "MBits": 1000,
      "ReservedPorts": null,
      "DynamicPorts": null
    }
  ]
}
```

doc: https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/http/node.html

!SUB
# Available Resources
- These are resources Nomad detects at **startup time**
- Processes not scheduled by Nomad are not considered
- Currently it is **not** possible to query unallocated resources

!SUB
# Reserving Resources
Jobs can specify **which** and **how many** resources the need. Nomad the may instruct
the task driver (e.g. Docker) to not let the process use more.

For example the default a job may specify (within the 'task' section):

```
resources {
	cpu = 500 # 500 Mhz
	memory = 256 # 256MB
	network {
		mbits = 10
		port "db" {
      static = 3306
		}
	}
}
```

# Things don't always go well in real life

!SUB
# Decommissioning nodes
We can let Nomad move all of a node's applications by letting it drain:
```
$ nomad node-drain -enable 37b31879
```
We can then view the status of the node with the node-status command:
```
$ nomad node-status
ID        DC    Name                  Class   Drain  Status
37b31879  dc1   bbakker-farm-01-pkdh  docker  true   ready
